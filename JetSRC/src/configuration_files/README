Aircraft configuration takes place from the included text files as follows.

- aircraft_types.txt 
	This file includes the name of each supported aircraft.
	Aircraft are separated by new lines
	example:
	CF-18
	F-16
	F-22


- store_codes.txt
	This file includes the name of each supported store.
	Stores are separated by new line and must include:
		a unique number (1-98), 
		unique name, 
		type (A-A, A-G, other),
		crjs values (carriage, release, jettison, seperation)
	example:
	4|GBU-12|A-G|1.1,0.9,0.9,2G-90

		
- aircraft_configurations.txt
	This file includes the allowed configurations for the designated aircraft.
	Configurations are represented in code form separated by a new line (text in brackets is explanation):
		CF-18 (type must match string in aircraft_types.txt)
		9 (number of pylons)
		1 2 3 99 (pylon 1 accepts store code 1, 2 and 3 - the 99 informs the interpreter to move to next store)
	example:
	CF-18 9 1 2 99 4 5 6 7 99 3 4 5 6 7 99 6 99 3 4 5 6 7 99 4 5 6 7 99 1 2 99
